Simple In/Out board for a friend of mine.  Basically allows you have a collection of users and each user can
display their status.  Nothing fancy at all.

Gems in use:

CanCan - Authorization
Devise - Authentication
Rails_Admin - Backend admin


Other than that its pretty much some simple javascript using jQuery and ERB which I personally dislike.
